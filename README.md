# RelearnHello

I first started programming in 1979. It was kind of a rough start. I switched out of programming and then back into programming in 1981. having excelled at Fortran and the end of card readers I decided to give it another try. By 1985 I had earned a computer science degree. To this day I am still programming and today specifically learning Git. Now editing git.
